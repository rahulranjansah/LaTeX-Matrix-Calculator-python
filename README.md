# Latex_Matrix_calcuator
A matrix calculator for solving matrix of shape m*n. It has built-in feature of getting latex output of the computation in .tex and .pdf format support with clean formatting for REFs, RREFs, Arithmetic operations, and Dot product


## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python
- Git

## Installation

To get started with the matrix calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell/terminal
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LaTeX-Matrix-Calculator-python.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell/terminal
   cd LaTeX-Matrix-Calculator-python
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies for the backend server by running the following command:

    ```shell/terminal
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the matrix calculator, follow these steps:

1. To start, run the following command

   ```shell/terminal
    python3 main.py
    ```

2. Enter the matrix elements in the terminal window, following the supported matrix format.

3. Click on the submit button to perform the desired operation on the matrix.

4. The results will be displayed in the terminal, including the matrix undergoing operations and the LaTeX code of the dot-product and adding-subtracting form matrices.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any suggestions or would like to add new features, please create a new issue or submit a pull request.

## Updates
- Code architechture has been restructured to develop a full-blown working software.

- n-dimensional support for dot-products, RREF, and REF problems with tex-pdf support

- Step-by-step solutions for all the problems

- sample tex and pdf has been committed

## Future Developments

We will be working on adding features to work with trignometeric function, pmatrix options, inverses, diagonalization, eigenvalues of matrices and hopefully, GPUs based architecture for support
